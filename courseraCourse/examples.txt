Caching the Mean of a Vector

<<- operator can be used to assign a value to an object in an environment that is different from the current environment. we have to write two functions that are used to create a special object that stores a numeric vector and cache's its mean.

source() 1. create a square matrix

seq1 <- seq(1:4) m1 <- matrix(seq1,2) m1 [,1] [,2] [1,] 1 3 [2,] 2 4
create a cacheable matrix

cm1 <- makeCacheMatrix(m1)
fetch the inverse matrix from cache

im1 <- cacheSolve(cm1) im1 [,1] [,2] [1,] -2 1.5 [2,] 1 -0.5
verify if result is correct

im2 <- solve(m1) im2 [,1] [,2] [1,] -2 1.5 [2,] 1 -0.5
Example 3 :

"loop functions" , "system functions" , "simulation functions"
